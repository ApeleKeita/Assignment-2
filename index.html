			<h2>Origin</h2>
			<p>The peach is original from China; it was taken to the West through commercial routes.
				It is one of the most important cultures in the world, with a global production around 10 thousand tons.
				The world production centres around the Mediterranean area, being Italy and Spain the main exporting countries.
				The peach tree (Prunus persica) is original from China, where references to the culture go 3000 years back. Later on, it was introduced in Persia by the commercial routes through the mountains, to an extent that it was known as Persica fruit, from where its scientifical name persica was taken. That is why many people wrongly think hat peaches come from Persia. The peaches arrived at Greece towards year 330 B.C. and during the Middle Ages they spreaded all around Europe. As far as the spreading of this culture, we can state that in America the Portuguese introduced the peach in the east coast of South America, the Spaniards do so in Mexico and Florida, the French in Luisiana and the English settlers in Virginia and Massachusetts.
				The peach and nectarine culture is one of the most technified among the fruit trees and it is very important in the agrarian economy of many countries.</p>

		<h2>Packaging</h2>
		<p>In some countries peaches are treated after harvesting with water and waxes to improve the appearance and to avoid their deterioration during the market distribution.
			Peaches are usually packaged in 4 and 6 kg baskets. Peaches and nectarines must be carefully handled during and after the harvesting, since it is a highly perishable fruit. </p>
